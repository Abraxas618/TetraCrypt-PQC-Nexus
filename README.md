## Overview

This repository combines two research branches of next-generation cryptographic exploration:

- **Omni-Causal Hyperlattice Cryptography**  
- **TetraSwarm: Platonic AI Mesh Consensus**

This is not merely code. It is a **philosophical and hyperdimensional framework** for post-quantum cryptography, merging biometric, Platonic, and swarm-based trust structures.

## 🔷 What is TetraCrypt?
TetraCrypt is a next-gen post-quantum cryptographic system, structured around advanced Platonic solid geometry and hyperdimensional lattice mappings.

🧩 Core Components:
- 🔐 **TKE** – Tetrahedral Key Exchange  
- 🔮 **QIDL** – Quantum Isoca-Dodecahedral Layering  
- 🧠 **RTH** – Recursive Tesseract Hashing  
- ⬛ **HBB** – 4D Hypercube Blockchain

## 📘 Papers Included:
- Omni-Causal Hyperlattice Cryptography.pdf
- TetraSwarm Protocol Architecture.pdf

## 🚀 Future Goals:
- Fully implement geometric encryption in NumPy
- Run distributed consensus on 4D ledger space
- Integrate EEG/DNA biometric factors into identity-based quantum mesh

## 🙏 Acknowledgments:

### ⏱ Blockchain Timestamp

This repository is part of the Codex encryption system. A cryptographic proof of authorship has been timestamped on the Bitcoin blockchain using [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org).

- [OpenTimestamps Proof File](./Codex_Blockchain_Archive.zip.ots)

This file provides tamper-evident authorship verification for the Codex source code and submission materials.
## 🔗 Distributed Integrity & Blockchain Authorship

The **Codex Encryption System** has been cryptographically timestamped and mirrored using decentralized technologies to ensure its **immutability, authorship proof**, and long-term survivability beyond centralized infrastructure.

## Overview

This repository combines two research branches of next-generation cryptographic exploration:

- **Omni-Causal Hyperlattice Cryptography**  
- **TetraSwarm: Platonic AI Mesh Consensus**

This is not merely code. It is a **philosophical and hyperdimensional framework** for post-quantum cryptography, merging biometric, Platonic, and swarm-based trust structures.

## Overview

This repository combines two research branches of next-generation cryptographic exploration:

- **Omni-Causal Hyperlattice Cryptography**  
- **TetraSwarm: Platonic AI Mesh Consensus**

This is not merely code. It is a **philosophical and hyperdimensional framework** for post-quantum cryptography, merging biometric, Platonic, and swarm-based trust structures.

## Philosophy

> "Geometry is the language of consciousness.  
> Encryption is the lock.  
> Tetrahedron is the key." — *Michael Tass MacDonald*

This work serves as a **blueprint from the future**, brought into present form as a gift to the Free and Open Source community and those who dare to imagine the impossible.

## 🔷 What is TetraCrypt?
TetraCrypt is a next-gen post-quantum cryptographic system, structured around advanced Platonic solid geometry and hyperdimensional lattice mappings.

🧩 Core Components:
- 🔐 **TKE** – Tetrahedral Key Exchange  
- 🔮 **QIDL** – Quantum Isoca-Dodecahedral Layering  
- 🧠 **RTH** – Recursive Tesseract Hashing  
- ⬛ **HBB** – 4D Hypercube Blockchain
